# Movie Information App

## Technology Used

- HTML: The app uses HTML for structuring the web page and defining its elements.
- CSS: CSS is used for styling the app and applying visual enhancements to the elements.
- JavaScript: The functionality of the app is implemented using JavaScript. It handles API requests, data manipulation, and event handling.

## Terms Used

- API: API stands for Application Programming Interface. In this project, the app interacts with The Movie Database (TMDB) API to fetch movie data such as trending movies and movie details.
- Fetch: Fetch is a built-in JavaScript function used to make asynchronous HTTP requests to fetch data from a specified URL. It is used to fetch movie data from the TMDB API.
- DOM Manipulation: DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation refers to the process of accessing and modifying HTML elements and their properties using JavaScript. It is used in this project to dynamically create and update movie cards and modal windows.
- Modal Window: A modal window is a dialog box or popup that appears on top of the web page content, often used to display additional information or interactive features. In this project, modal windows are used to show detailed movie information when a movie card is clicked.
- Local Storage: Local storage is a web browser feature that allows data to be stored locally on the user's device. In this project, existing user registrations are stored in local storage to enable user registration and sign-in functionality.
- JSON: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is used in this project to parse and handle data received from the TMDB API.
